					<p>To color the above words, we, the ZITAians, both make a record and break the record by the hand landed by our association ZITA - Zealous Information Technology Association. ZITA always flutters its feathers with a pride of its unanimity.  The harmony of ZITA can be witnessed through the various functions thatwe conduct. Few of the functions are:</p>
					<h3>DECADE'16</h3>
						<center><h3>“The future is developed from the past”</h3></center>
						<p>To satisfy this saying we had our alumni from the year 2006 who were the founders of this great association ZITA. Decennium, after a long period of ten years they shared their knowledge and experience with us.</p>
			<h3>CONNECT’16</h3>
			<p>It is in the hands of the mother bird to take care of its off spring to fly over sky successfully. Likewise, our alumni nourishes our knowledge with the latest happenings of the IT world which will be helpful to overcome the obstacles.
